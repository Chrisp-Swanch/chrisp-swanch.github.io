          <h3>Sprint Five - Core</h3>
          <hr style="color: black"/>
        </div>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph"><em>28 April 2023</em></p>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">This is my refreshed learning plan, heading into the final week before bootcamp.</p>
        
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">
          This hasn't really changed since the beginning of foundations. As for the impact I'd like to have, I'm always looking for ways to use my time in a way that reflects my values- eg., working at Archives was good for this, because I believed in the value of the work.
        </p>
          
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">
          Long-term, my goal is to be able to work remotely and have flexibility with where I want to live and work, and to work across different projects and companies. Adding dev skills to my repertoire will be useful for this. I don't have any rigid expectations or goals around particular companies or fields of specialisation, I'd just like to be able to take these skills with me wherever I choose to go, and to have tools for doing personal creative projects
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in bootcamp?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">
          I tend to get on well socially in these kinds of settings. I'd really like to contribute to the social atmosphere, and have an environment that is supportive and uplifting. I think getting up in the morning on time every day will become a drag- I hate mornings! However I am used to working to a bootcamp-esque schedule from time to time, due to my past work experience in the events and wine industries.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp will be?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">
          I'll no doubt find myself worried about money (re. during and after the course), and I'm sure that will get distracting. I think it'll be a challenge to keep myself fed and watered without blowing the time/monetary budgets.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What 'human skills' would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3> 
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">
          I would like to see my ability to self-motivate and self-manage develop during bootcamp. I think I already have good habits, but one can always improve. I'd also like to hone my ability to compartmentalise work and private life, whilst still thriving in each of those areas.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What are your expectations of the bootcamp team?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">
          I expect to be able to trust their approach. It makes things easy for me when I know I can have confidence that how the course is being run, is imperically a good approach- that way I can hand myself over, in a sense, to engage with the course open-mindedly. That has been my experience to date in foundations.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What are your expectations of yourself on bootcamp?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">
          I expect full commitment from myself, and I don't doubt that I'll deliver that. I would expect that as part of this, I will consciously take steps to recognise and manage myself/help myself when I face challenges. I also expect that I will take time to help others- to take notice of others and to take opportunities to help with other's learning experience.

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph"><em>17 April 2023</em></p>

        <p>Here, I've put together a plan as per the Te Whare Tapa Whā exercise. To make sure not to clutter my 'plans/commitments' environment, I've decanted some actions from my learning plan above into this structure, and put these into my personal notes as a reminder to myself.</p>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph"><em>9 April 2023</em></p>

        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Long-term, my goal is to be able to work remotely and have flexibility with where I want to live and work, and to work across different projects and companies. Adding dev skills to my repertoire will be useful for this. I don't have any rigid expectations or goals around particular companies or fields of specialisation, I'd just like to be able to take these skills with me wherever I choose to go. I would be happy to return to the GLAM/Heritage sector, as I've come from working at Archives.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Describe your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I think the flipped learning model works well for me. I am strong at self-scheduling. I am also strong at being thorough and meticulous with my learning, and am always determined to feel like I've really got my head around something before moving on. I take a lot of notes and keep them well organised- it's really important for me to feel like I've got my thoughts organised for what I am working on. When I inevitably notice gaps in my knowledge, or have questions I want to explore later, I always write them down so I can revisit it without it becoming too distracting in the moment.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I find I'll often start strong with a task and then lose momentum after a while. If I dedicate a lot of mental energy to a task, it can be difficult to continually reset when moving from one thing to another. I'm confident with asking for help, but can't help but be aware of taking up other peoples' time. Sometimes trying to find solutions myself can be time consuming.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I'm interested to see how I can contribute to the group learning experience. I'd like to see myself develop in that way, to support my peers. Often coding can be quite a mentally all-consuming task if you're thinking deeply in a sustained way. I feel like coming back down to earth can take some time, so I'd like to find a way to feel a bit more 'present' whilst working on these sorts of things. Regularly interacting with other learners could be a benefit to this.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Share your commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3> 
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I am committed to being accountable to my peers, which will help me set expectations of myself. I will manage my workload by planning ahead, and making time to look after myself, and also to participate socially with my fellow learners in a positive way. I will check in regularly with facilitators and group members to make sure that expectations are aligned and on-track.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">When things are building up and getting to me, I will slow down and try to look at the bigger picture. Taking walks can help with this. I will seek help from peers or facilitators if any deadlines or other expectations are at risk.</p>
        
        <!-- This should include:
        
        - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.
        
        - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. -->
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What are your expectations of the Facilitation team?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I'd expect the facilitators to provide direction and guidance. Really I'd just like to feel supported and understood, and to be able to pick their brains and seek technical or career/industry advice.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Share any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I'm pretty free with my scheduling, I expect bootcamp in particular to be very time-heavy, and so made sure that the time I'd be at Dev Academy was left open.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">My brother is being admitted to the bar in late May, and so if it's at all possible, I'd really like to go and celebrate that with him and my family in Auckland that weekend. I'm prepared not to if it won't work out with the workload- I am acting under the assumption that it won't be possible.</p>
        
        <!-- For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. -->

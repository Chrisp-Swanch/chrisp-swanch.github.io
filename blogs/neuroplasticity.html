        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2> 
        <h3>Sprint Four - Core</h3>
        <hr style="color: black"/>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph"><em>17 April 2023</em></p>

        <h3>Research Neuroplasticity</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</em></li>
          <li><em>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</em></li>
          <li><em>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</em></li>
          <li><em>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is beneficial in a number of ways. It allows people to learn and re-learn, break habits and form new ones consciously. It's through neuroplasticity that people can change and adapt- these are key skills in in life, including in a career context.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">So far during Foundations, I have been revising daily- as a standard, 15mins revision on the learning I did the previous day. I've also been journaling daily in my notes app, and taking time to do at least ~5mins meditation, at least once a day. I've found that this sort of routine has been really helpful for my learning- I think it's consistent with the principles of neuroplasticity in learning, as I'm strengthening pathways made during learning, and developing a habit of approaching each day with a calm and energised mind and a positive attitude. For me, I've found that it's helped to keep the bigger picture in mind as I work through.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">When I was researching Neuroplasticity, I was reminded of some concepts from other areas- In AI/neural networks, there's a concept called 'main path analysis', which is to examine which 'pathways' an artificial neural network is using to come to a result. It's often used for instance, in citation networks, to calculate the impact/influence of particular publications. It reminded me of the 'traffic' analogy given in the student handbook.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Similarly, 'load path analysis' is a concept from engineering/structural design. It's the idea of designing structures in a way that supports mechanical loads efficiently and intuitively- Here's a <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUfO3Ia8Io" target="_blank">video on the topic</a>. I think this idea is really analogous to the way we can use neuroplasticity to increase our ability to learn and develop skills. Instead of a wooden frame supporting a roof, we build strong pathways in our minds to support ourselves to develop towards learning goals, be it in terms of attitude/outlook, strategy, or technical concepts.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">'Critical path analysis' (there's a theme here?) is a concept in business analysis and management- it's the idea of strengthening resources for parts of a workflow which are critical to achieving desired outcomes. The same concept can be applied to a learning process- Having the right attitude and habits are on the critical path to learning the course content and so are worthy of reinforcement.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Research Growth Mindset</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li><em>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</em></li>
          <li><em>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</em></li>
          <li><em>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</em></li>
          <li><em>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">'Growth mindset', essentially, is about having a mental attitude which is conducive to achieving goals- This includes having persistence, resilience and adaptability to inevitable challenges. It is an alternative model to a 'fixed mindset', an attitude through which setbacks, challenges and the unexpected are seen as blockers- having a fixed mindset means you are far more likely not to persist, or to back away from a challenge when it gets difficult.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">One of the ones most surprising and interesting takeaways for me personally, is that simply having knowledge of the concept has been shown to improve learning outcomes. I think that being equipped with that knowledge gives confidence to learners that they are capable and able to learn effectively, and subsequently achieve well, with the right attitude and engagement.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I will integrate this knowledge into my learning journey by reflecting each day on the challenges I met, and revising content as I go. It might mean that some concepts require me to revisit them and practice in order to fully understand them. This is consistent with the concept of 'the power of yet', which Carol Dweck talks about in <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">There are known misconceptions about growth mindsets that <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4" target="_blank">this video</a> by the Harvard Business Review explains concisely. It also talks about 'fixed-mindset triggers' which can make it harder to maintain the right attitude- triggers such as facing challenges, criticism, and comparing ourselves to others can have this effect.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li><em>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">The growth mindset and neuroplasticity concepts may influence the way in which I define and work towards my longer-term career goals. At the moment I'm content with having the scope of  my goals fall within engaging with, and succeeding at Dev Academy. In the future it may be helpful to have more of an idea of exactly what I want for myself, so I can work towards that.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I can use neuroplasticity to develop my ability to manage time and mental energy when it comes to working through many different tasks in one work day. Changing my behaviours through small actions and anchors, as described in previous blogs could help with this- such as meditating between curriculum sections.</p>

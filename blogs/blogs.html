      <p>Here are the blogs that I've written as I've progressed through the sprints. That's pretty self-explanatory, this text is here <em>primarily</em> to look nice.</p>

        Sprint One - Core
      </h1>
      <p>
        Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.

        <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2> 
        <h3>Sprint Five - Core</h3>
        <hr style="color: black"/>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph"><em>28 April 2023</em></p>

        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><p class="blogpost-paragraph">I liked having the insight of understanding neuroplasticity. It's a confidence-builder to know that it's perfectly possible to change our habits and patterns of thought in deliberate ways that help us achieve our goals.</p></li>
          <li><p class="blogpost-paragraph">The core learning revealed that I have 'low assertiveness', which made sense to me in the context of other conversations I'd been having recently. It also reconfirmed other, positive qualities I/others have seen in myself.</p></li>
          <li><p class="blogpost-paragraph">I need not be afraid of anything, really. Daily meditations have been really nice to slow down and become energised and excited.</p></li>
        </ul>
   
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">To have a successful career as a programmer, you need to work with others. Values, empathy, self-awareness etc are critical to operating in, and succeeding in, that environment. Being self-compassionate, and compassionate to others makes teams work together much better- and also personal learning.</p>

        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I think the introduction of daily meditations into my schedule has been really great- to set time aside habitually to re-focus, feel clear and energised, has improved my focus, mood and learning. That was surprising to me. Also, the practice that was introduced around daily goal-setting etc has been a really good way for me to track and monitor my progress, and notice my habits.</p>

        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">The learning plan and the Te Whare Tapa Whā exercise were tricky to put together, in a way. I have my own ways of planning and being self-accountable. Having a learning plan was easy to have as part of this, but Te Whare Tapa Whā on top of that made me feel like me commitment environment was getting too cluttered and decentralised. It made it harder to keep track.</p>

        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I think it's because there's a need for these skills in industry, and this course is designed to get people job-ready. I'm also realising that programming isn't about 'knowing lot of things', or memorising things, but rather to develop a practice of problem-solving, investigation, refinement, solution-building and so on.</p>

        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Personally, I feel like it was time well-used. The core content made me feel better equipped to learn the technical content. The perspectives and insights offered in the core modules helped me to feel confident and to have a good attitude through foundations. If it was purely technical-focussed, the whole thing would have been far more daunting, and needlessly so.</p>

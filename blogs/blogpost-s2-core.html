        <h2>My Learning Plan</h2> 
        <h3>Sprint Two - Core</h3>
        <hr style="color: black"/>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph"><em>9 April 2023</em></p>

        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Long-term, my goal is to be able to work remotely and have flexibility with where I want to live and work, and to work across different projects and companies. Adding dev skills to my repertoire will be useful for this. I don't have any rigid expectations or goals around particular companies or fields of specialisation, I'd just like to be able to take these skills with me wherever I choose to go. I would be happy to return to the GLAM/Heritage sector, as I've come from working at Archives.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Describe your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I think the flipped learning model works well for me. I am strong at self-scheduling. I am also strong at being thorough and meticulous with my learning, and am always determined to feel like I've really got my head around something before moving on. I take a lot of notes and keep them well organised- it's really important for me to feel like I've got my thoughts organised for what I am working on. When I inevitably notice gaps in my knowledge, or have questions I want to explore later, I always write them down so I can revisit it without it becoming too distracting in the moment.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I find I'll often start strong with a task and then lose momentum after a while. If I dedicate a lot of mental energy to a task, it can be difficult to continually reset when moving from one thing to another. I'm confident with asking for help, but can't help but be aware of taking up other peoples' time. Sometimes trying to find solutions myself can be time consuming.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I'm interested to see how I can contribute to the group learning experience. I'd like to see myself develop in that way, to support my peers. Often coding can be quite a mentally all-consuming task if you're thinking deeply in a sustained way. I feel like coming back down to earth can take some time, so I'd like to find a way to feel a bit more 'present' whilst working on these sorts of things. Regularly interacting with other learners could be a benefit to this.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Share your commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3> 
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I am committed to being accountable to my peers, which will help me set expectations of myself. I will manage my workload by planning ahead, and making time to look after myself, and also to participate socially with my fellow learners in a positive way. I will check in regularly with facilitators and group members to make sure that expecations are aligned and on-track.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">When things are building up and getting to me, I will slow down and try to look at the bigger picture. Taking walks can help with this. I will seek help from peers or facilitators if any deadlines or other expectations are at risk.</p>
        
        <!-- This should include:
        
        - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.
        
        - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. -->
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">What are your expectations of the Facilitation team?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I'd expect the facilitators to provide direction and guidance. Really I'd just like to feel supported and understood, and to be able to pick their brains and seek technical or career/industry advice.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Share any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I'm pretty free with my scheduling, I expect bootcamp in particular to be very time-heavy, and so made sure that the time I'd be at Dev Academy was left open.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">My brother is being admitted to the bar in late May, and so if it's at all possible, I'd really like to go and celebrate that with him and my family in Auckland that weekend. I'm prepared not to if it won't work out with the workload- I am acting under the assumption that it won't be possible.</p>
        
        <!-- For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. -->

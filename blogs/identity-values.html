        <h3>Sprint One - Core</h3>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph"><em>31 March 2023</em></p>

        <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">A colleague of mine experienced a break-up. Part of my response was to invite them to a regular social event at my place, which they accepted. They also asked if they could stay overnight, to get out of the house. It was an easy decision to let them stay for as long as they need- Despite not knowing them very deeply on a personal level, I value being able to reach out and be able to lean on friends, and also want to reward/acknowledge the bravery and difficulty of asking for this kind of help.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I feel very lucky and privileged to be in a position where I have space at my flat to offer. Availing this for them also benefits me, in that it utilises a surplace that I have at my personal disposal, one which to a point is taken for granted, but which is not inherently mine. On reflection, I'm happy with the decision and would do it again.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I have been inspired by many others in my life- family, friends, mentors, colleagues. They demonstrate qualities which alter my perspectives, and their actions and attitudes teach me how to live in a way which reflects and reinforces my values. One example I often think of is my Mum, who values hospitality.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">She described her experience growing up with many siblings, and having a house which was always open for friends to use. She appreciated this, and said she wanted to create that sort of welcoming environment at her own home, which she has done all my life- I too appreciate it for the same reasons, and it has become a value of mine as well. I have a friend who makes ceramics, and the spirit of hospitality is an underlying principle in their work- I find it inspiring that the principle can be applied in these ways.</p>

        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I am strong in a teamwork context. I am a problem-solver and big-picture thinker. I'm a strong communicator, an empathetic listener and have good emotional intelligence. I'm known my gregariousness and sense of humour. These strengths will support me through my learning, by enabling me to share and be shared with. This suits well with the in-person/group learning model.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">It can be intimidating beginning a new journey, in a new field. Having consistent motivation can be a challenge. I find that having faith in the quality of my decision-making can be helpful. <em>"I decided to undertake the task, having taken into account the risks and realities, and so despite inherent challenges, I am on a good pathway."</em></p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I can get bogged-down with becoming stuck on something I don't know or understand. I end up spending too much mental energy trying to unravel it before moving on, by which time I struggle to begin the next task.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">In terms of career development, I have proven myself able to achieve what I set out to do over the long-term. My only worry would be ending up in an unsatisfactory working environment. This will affect my learning in a positive way, I think. I'll be motivated to learn and progress in the right areas.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">I worked closely with someone on a daily basis for a while last year. Most of the time we worked very well together, but the proximity caused issues from time to time. Learning to set boundaries and limits, and to recognise these in others, is critical to avoiding difficulty. Even so, tension can arise.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Strategies I tried were to focus on work-related conversation, distance myself where possible, and talking through issues where appropriate. These were effective most of the time. On reflection I would work on my assertiveness- in terms of communicating and addressing, rather than ignoring, as backing away/avoiding can reach it's limits as a strategy and even worsen the problem.</p>

        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Emotional intelligence, as I understand it, is to have the ability to empathise with and understand the feelings and perspectives of ones self, and others, and to use this insight to bring about positive interactions. To develop emotional intelligence, it pays to pay close attention to one's own thoughts and feelings, and patterns of behaviour in order to work best with yourself, including how best to interact with others.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Dr. Daniel Goleman, in <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ngIFlmRRPQ" target="_blank">this video</a> explains some key EQ and relationship competencies that relate to success. Questions such as;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How well you manage yourself?</li>
          <li>Do you persist towards goals despite challenges?</li>
          <li>Do you have a negative or a positive outlook?</li>
          <li>Do you tune into others?</li>
          <li>Do you notice others?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">He goes on to explain that to be successful, one doesn't have to simply be 'good' at job-related tasks, but to co-ordinate, persuade, and be a good team-player. These make the difference in the work setting, as opposed to operating in isolation.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">My understanding is that IQ relates to cognitive ability. It is supposed to be a measure of intelligence. This could be the ability to notice patterns and insights, to comprehend and reason, make abstract connections mentally, commit information to long-term memory, and to be able to recall this and apply it to problems.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Personally I've never really taken the concept of IQ too seriously. I tend to think it's a narrow way of understanding people, and that every individual has a well-developed way of viewing the world through their own lens. In <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o73aHzcksM" target="_blank">this video</a>, Dr. Todd Grande says that IQ isn't an instrument that is used so much any more, particularly in mental health settings.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Dr. Daniel Goleman, in <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ngIFlmRRPQ" target="_blank">this video</a> says that IQ has no correlation with success in the workplace, as defined by how their peers assessed them. Instead, EQ was the primary predictive factor. To paraphrase,</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph"><em>"There is a strong 'floor' effect for IQ in any role- the range of variance is far less with IQ as compared to EQ."</em></p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">To me, this means that general competence in 'technical' job skills is almost taken for granted, as  in it's expected that an engineer for instance will know about physics and calculus, or that a physiotherapist will have knowledge of anatomy. However, one can have this sort of technical knowledge without necessarily having the emotional intelligence to work well with others, and be a good team player. Therefore EQ has a stronger correlation with success in the workplace, as judged by their peers. EQ is learned, and learnable. IQ is more innate and harder to train.</p>
        
        <h3 class="blogpost-header-top-padding">Why is EQ important?</h3>
        
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">Having a well-developed sense of empathy leads to having positive experiences with others. It is conducive to team/work/social environments that are uplifting, inclusive and supportive. In my personal experience, and anecdotal observations from talking to others, workplace culture and people are very important for peoples' sense of enjoying a job. It makes a huge difference, and having EQ is a key factor in this.</p>
        <p class="blogpost-paragraph">EQ is correlated with success in high-level positions in companies. People who make decisions on hiring are trained to recognise EQ in potential hires, because it is recognised as important in a workplace setting. So, EQ is important if we want to achieve our career goals- we have to work well with others, which means being understanding and empathetic, including towards ourselves.</p>
